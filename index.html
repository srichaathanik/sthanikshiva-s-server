	<p>This is a custom-made Server used by PHP, HTML, CSS and etc..</p>

	<p>I am thrilled to tell you that this server is made by an 12-year old named "Sricharan Sivakumar" formely known as "Sricha Thanik Shiva" (S ThanikShiva). Here, this server helps me to my day to day life. Because, I access all my files and reference books here and also my details are all in this website. Here, I have my Public Material which stores my materials known as my work. Like code, documents,pictures and diagrams.This helps my friends to access the source code and some of my subject notes. I hope this Idea finds it useful for you and other students.</p>
